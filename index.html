<h3> Adventures of Zuzka! </h3>
<h5> Introduction </h5>
</center>
<pre>
I live in a world where there are many superpowers in every person. They range from relatively useless ones from insane super natural abilities like breathing fire, Throwing acidic stuff everywhere and many many more. Since the incident of the superpowers there has been a insane rise in crimes. So, that's why there are many superheroes who risk their lived to save the people from the villains which attack the cities, countries or even the entire world. And yes, I too want to be a hero like everyone here. Oh yeah! I forgot to tell you my name, its Zuzka. Ok, remember when i told you about that i wanted to be a hero, well there is a problem to that. Out of everyone in this community. I wasn't born with a superpower. But still I didn't give up. And I got superpowers from someone I really admired, you will see. And oh yeah, this is a story of how i became the world's greatest hero.

So just like I told you that I wanted to be a hero. I want to be just like the best hero there is known as Toshinori. He is a brave hero who saves people with a smile on his face. When he entered the world of pro heroes, he was already on the top 3. After 1 month he surpassed everyone and became the world's greatest hero. I wanted to be just like him.
 
Before 10 years.
 
I was at the doctors because it was odd that i didn't develop a power while other students at my class already manifested their ones.
 
"Sorry kid it is not gonna happen", said the doctor.
 
"So there is something wrong then, I was wondering that since all the other kids already have their powers in his class", said my mother.
 
"By researching your DNA it is clear that you have no coding of superpowers. I am sorry" again said the doctor.
 
After that I reached home and cried over my bed. My mom was sad too. And after that day I decided that I am a useless one of this society.
 
In this day, I still wanted to be a hero even though i had no powers. I was walking to school and in front of me, there was Chris who was a bully to me and always teasing me. But this day he didn't feel like it so he didn't do anything.
 
"Get out of my way, gullible", said Chris
 
Gullible is what Chris calls me to make fun of me.
 
"Ye..yea..yeah.... o....ok"
 
Honestly I am really scared of Chris. He has a awesome superpower, i.e. Half Fire and Half Air. He can throw flames from his left arms and can manipulate air with his right arms. 
And then one incident happened.
I saw one big explosion in the middle of the city. I ran down to the place where that incident was happening but Chris just went wherever he wanted to be.
When I was running by, came a villain right in front of me and caught me right away.
"HeHe HE HEE! Don't worry it will only hurt for a while and then IT WILL KILL YOU.", said the villain
I was terrified.
